ST7735 TFT-Library for PIC-Microcontrollers 
===========================================

**work in progress**


Overview
--------

This is a port of the Adafruit ST7735-library for PIC microcontrollers.
The code is a copy of <https://github.com/gavinlyonsrepo/pic_16F18346_projects>
with some minor modifications to make the code compatible with my
[pic-toolchain](https://github.com/bablokb/pic-toolchain). To use the code,
you have to install the makefile-rules and header files of the toolchain.

For own projects, copy the `lib` and `include` directories and use the
code and makefile within `demo` as a starting point.
